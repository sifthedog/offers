This is a tiny CRUD solution made using Ruby On Rails.



## How to run
---
This projects runs on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Therefore, in order to run this project, you're required to install Docker and Docker-Compose following the official instructions. You must run the [additional steps to manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

Once Docker is installed on your computer, just type `sh build.sh` inside the project's root folder.  

After finished, you may reach the project on port 3001.

If you wish to access the admin panel, it's running on '/offers'.

If you ever wanna run this again, just type `sh run.sh` inside the project's rool folder.

Also, if you are not in the mood of following all these steps and just want to checkout how it looks (it's far from beatiful), it's deployed on [Heroku Sif Offers](https://sif-offers.herokuapp.com/).
